No matter what you call it, you’ll always have a place in my heart that no one else can take. And that’s something even time can’t change.  I’m truly sorry for anything that upset you. You mean everything to me. I can’t imagine my life without you. Happy Birthday, and I hope you can forgive me. ❤️ unblock kro  @aye3ha._  .. ! .. @enhalvs";
